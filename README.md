Python FLAMES Tookit

The python FLAMES (Florida Laboratory for Materials Engineering Simulation) Toolkit is a collection of functions, and libraries that I wrote while at the University of Florida to study materials science.  By it's very nature, it is an incomplete toolkit and a work in progress.
